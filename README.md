### 🔍 Safe Chat Command (Age) ###
  This command is very intesting beacuse you have script it by requesting the the user to say the words like this
  ```lua
function API.Players.getPlayerInfo(Player: Player): {number | string}
	local age = "false"
	local safeChat = "true"
	if API.Players.getPlayerByName(Player.Name) ~= nil then
		age = Player.AccountAge
		local filterResult = TextService:FilterStringAsync('C7RN', Player.UserId)
		if filterResult:GetChatForUserAsync(Player.UserId) == 'C7RN' then
			safeChat = "false"
		end
	end
	return {age, safeChat}
end
```
